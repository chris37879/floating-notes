*Version: 0.5*

This boilerplate is just a flat index.html file, [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/ 'Normalize.css'), [jQuery](http://jquery.com 'jQuery'), [html5shiv](http://code.google.com/p/html5shiv/ 'Modernizr'), [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/ 'Stylus') style files, and a compiled CSS file linked in the final document. The boilerplate includes more files than just these so be sure to see it's README.md for more information about each included piece.
